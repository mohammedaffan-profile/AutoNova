# AutoNova v1 🚀

**AutoNova** is a plug-and-play smart check-in system for hotels and stays, built to ensure *zero-human-contact* guest entry. It’s designed to be embedded within existing hotel apps like OYO or run standalone for budget property owners.

## 🔐 Core Features
- Self-check-in Kiosk UI (Scan ID, Select Room, Pay via UPI, Get Access)
- Access via PIN / QR / OTP (Smart lock ready)
- Admin Dashboard for Partners (Guest view, Room status, Reports)
- Real-time sync to prevent room conflicts
- Privacy-first: ID verification without storing PII
